You ask good questions! Birth locations can be (and often are) difficult to track down. Sometimes all I’ve had to go on is what is listed as birth place in a census record, and those can be pretty squishy. But I can help a little in trying to define just where the Cherokee Nation East was. I know of course that East Tennessee was CNE. There are several good clues on that, such as the burial site for Na-ni (Nancy Ward). I know that northwestern Georgia was part of the Nation, too, but just how far east that went is often quite hazy. I know that northern Alabama was included, because of the locations cited in histories of several of the major Cherokee figures. If you could tell me which ones are eluding you, perhaps I have additional info that we both could use.In 1818 or thereabouts, the Cherokees were granted a large parcel of land to the west, and people could sign up for reservations (land reserved for the individual). I knew that what is now eastern Oklahoma was included, but what I had been unaware of was how far east into Arkansas that extended. I was surprised to learn that it reached as far as Independence County (which is where the Bells lived until about 1910 — I’d have to check on the accuracy of that date). Sometimes you can get a strong clue from where they are buried, as up until the time of the Removal (1838), they tended to stay pretty much in the same place.The Delaware Indians were a “fragment” tribe that was absorbed by the Cherokees. When the tribe was removed to Oklahoma, their share of eastern Oklahoma was divided into several districts, one of which was Delaware. Delaware County is immediately south of Ottawa County (where I was born and grew up).Today, headquartered in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation has a tribal jurisdictional area spanning 14 counties in the northeastern corner of Oklahoma. These are Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Delaware, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Ottawa, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington counties. The wicipedia article this came from has some interesting insight on the history.Came across this site and it looks very useful!

Afton (where Grandy and I were both born) was then in Delaware District, but is now in Ottawa County.I’m delighted to find this web page — it also lays out much of the Cherokee Nation East!! I’m so glad you wrote and asked those questions because it prompted me to go hunting and am I finding things! I’m finding this site <https://www.google.com/search?q=map+Cherokee+Nation+West+districts&client=firefox-b-1-ab&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=1l15synX1IZTvM%253A%252C2j3OSBAYllyTMM%252C_&usg=__eTwBcY45yZPy_fp0CpCC4298oLc%3D&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi68fGC55nbAhViNH0KHVeIAbQQ9QEIfTAH#imgrc=6Q7UrFEgWes0aM:> is great because it has so many maps!As a side item, the map of the districts shows a cut-out corner of the Delaware district, a part which is now Ottawa County and that little hunk is where a lot of fragment tribes, whose names persist in place names in the county. If you look at the map labelled Cherokee Nation 15 districts,in D10, you’ll see a little finger of land sticking out from Grove. That’s Monkey Island, where the Rolston cemetery is — remember we visited it back in 2012? That’s where Grandmother’s people are buried, or a great many of them. The Nidiffers had a farm in that immediate area, and her grandfather Nidiffer had a store in Bernice (which is now under that sprawling Lake Grand Lake.) At the age of 18, she served as postmistress in that store.That rather jagged edge of the district is the Neosho River, which we crossed going from my parents’ home into Miami.I’m going to sign off now and go do some more digging. Thanks for the encouragement (from your questions.)
